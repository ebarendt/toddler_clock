# Toddler Clock

Remotely controllable clock for toddlers.

Toddlers can't tell time, but they can recognize different colors. This is similar to commercial models that change from yellow to green when it's ok for the child to be awake. The WiFi addition means that parents can change the time the clock changes from another room.

If the child had a rough night's sleep and should sleep longer, extend it a few minutes.
If they wake up a bit early and there's no way they're going back to sleep, turn it green so you don't have to "give in" in getting them up while the light is still yellow.
